# Web-App-RPG
A very basic project just whilst I learn web development and JavaScript, an RPG-like game with leveling, choices and progressive enemies.

This is my first jump into GitHub, and the project will be a slow burner that I will gradually improve over a long period of time.

To anyone reading, any ideas for expansions, or general improvements are appreciated!
